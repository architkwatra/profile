        I like to play cricket in my free time and I have been playing it since my middle school.
        I was a part of my undergraduate cricket team and we won the AKMF cricket tournament 
        in my first year. I also won the best bowler award in my third year of undergraduate studies. I am a 
        member of the current NC State's cricket team as well. I also like to cook food and try new cuisines whenever I get time.
